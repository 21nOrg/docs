> This release brings performance improvements, new feature to import historical time tracking data from other apps and many other bug fixes to make the app smoother, performant and better than ever before.

Here are the list of all major features released in this version:

### ðŸŽ† Import from other time tracking apps
Users can now import their historical time tracking data if the user used any of the time tracking apps earlier. The apps include Atracker, Toggl track, Session and Timemator.

### ðŸ”¥ Performance improvements
We have improved the app loading time and database querying latency with some architectural changes to our backend system. The initial loading time of the app should now be reduced significantly and any new users will be presented with an option to choose their closest region for data hosting.

### ðŸš€ Mode of interaction settings and command only mode
We have introduced a brand new setting called "Mode of interaction". This dramatically changes the way a user interacts with the application.

With this setting, user can choose between:

**Default mode**: For those who like their apps traditional and mouse-friendly. This is a combination of all modes where the user can still use hot keys, keyboard shortcuts and Command bar. But, none of those will come in the way to enable more visual experience.

**Keyboard centric**: Unleash the power of hotkeys and leave your mouse in the dust.

**Command only mode**: For the ultimate power user who wants to control Pointron like a coding maestro.

To use this setting - Go to Settings and choose Mode of interaction or search for Mode of Interaction from Command bar.
