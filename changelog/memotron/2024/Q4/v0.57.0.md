Go to properties editor and choose the newly available Multi select property for your multi select needs. Also, you can now create option groups to group a set of options together for ease of use.

### Universal properties
Creating a property is never easy than now. Universal properties are pre-defined select properties where we do all the work of pre-creating options so that you can instantly use the property without the need to define every single option.

### Suspension notice

We have temporarily suspended Semantic search capability and we will reintroduce it after making necessary changes. Provided below are the details on why we made this decision.

Currently, for semantic search to work, the app generates vector embeddings and stores them on user’s database. This is fine if you are a offline user. But for cloud sync version, to achieve occasional full offline capability, the app currently copies the entire database to user’s device on first login from remote server. Then it subsequently syncs changes made on other devices. As vector embeddings are huge in size, this is causing significant latency issues during sync. Therefore, we are experimenting a possible solution to keep some data heavy features like semantic search, access history, time-series data etc as cloud only features so that we don’t have to sync or full clone on each user device.

:::note

Full offline users will still have access to all these features. The only difference is cloud sync users will no longer be able to use certain features like Semantic search, history etc without connecting to the internet.
