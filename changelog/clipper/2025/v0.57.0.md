### Collections in clipper
- This update brings collections to Clipper side panel. Use collections to quickly open previously saved web pages, tweets, youtube videos etc.
- This is a drop-in replacement for scattered bookmarks across sites like Twitter bookmarks, Youtube saved playlists, saved web pages on browser bookmarks bar etc. right in the browser.
- This eliminates the need to open Memotron app every time the user want to open previously saved web pages.
- Incremental improvements on this feature will be available in the next few updates.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the title of youtube timestamp clip was overflowing if the title is large in the side panel

- Fixed wrong placeholder message in search results for link box when `@` prefix is used.
- Fixed an issue where avatar wasn’t rendered as expected for link search results since the last Memotron app update.
- Fixed an issue where enable toolbar action was not showing in side panel at some times when the toolbar was hidden.
