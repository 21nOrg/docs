Did you use any of the below apps in your lifetime?

Are you wondering why they are no longer around? That's because they never had a plan to last and here's why.
The most common reasons why software gets sunsetted are:
- Company exits (e.g. Yahoo, AOL, Myspace, etc.)
- Scalability requirement (e.g. Google Reader, )
- Company inefficiencies
  - Cash runout, resource insufficiency, operating costs
- Externalities
    - Compliance and legal
    - Regulatory changes
    - Market disruption (e.g. Internet Explorer, Orkut, Friendster, etc.)
    - Underlying Operating system support
- Pivots and changes

### Exit by acquisition
A venture capital backed company is expected to exit to make a return on investment. Most commonly these days, companies are acquired by larger companies or go public through an IPO. Acquired companies are often shut down or integrated into the acquiring company.


### Scalability requirement
