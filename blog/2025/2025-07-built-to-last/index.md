Did you use any of the below apps in your lifetime?
1. Google Reader
2. Vine
3. Pocket
4. 

Are you wondering why these tools are no longer around? That's because most of the tools that we use today never had a plan to last and here's why.

The most common reasons why software gets sunsetted are:
- Company exits by aquisition (e.g. -)
- Scalability requirement (e.g. Google Reader, Vine, Pocket, etc.)
- Company inefficiency
  - Cash runout, resource insufficiency, operating costs
- Externalities
    - Regulatory changes
    - Market disruption (e.g. Internet Explorer, Skype, Friendster, etc.)
    - Compliance and legal
    - Underlying Operating system support
- Pivots and changes

### Exit by acquisition
A venture capital backed company is expected to exit to make a return on investment. Most commonly these days, companies are acquired by larger companies or go public through an IPO. Acquired companies are often shut down or integrated into the acquiring company.

#### Acqui-hires
There is even a term for this - acqui-hires. It is a term used to describe the practice of acquiring a company for the sake of the talent and not given a damn about the product or its users.

Take example of Skiff. Skiff, an encrypted email and productivity startup with nearly 2 million users, was acquired by Notion in February 2024 and completely shut down within 12 months. Unlike typical integrations, Skiff users cannot even migrate their accounts to Notion. Users must manually export all data, and their @skiff.com email addresses will be permanently lost. The shutdown particularly affected privacy-conscious users who specifically chose Skiff for its end-to-end encryption capabilities.

So, why did this happen in the first place?
Skiff had raised $14.2 million from prominent investors including Sequoia Capital, Alphabet chairman John Hennessy, and former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang. An exit strategy, liquidation terms are intrinsicly part of any venture capital investment. So, why would the company or its investors stop an acquistion which would benefit them? The acquisition price was not disclosed, but the shutdown left millions of users scrambling for alternatives.

See an extensive list of acqui-hires via our open-source compilation [here](https://github.com/21nOrg/awsesome-flipped).


Its not that all acquisitions result in a shutdown. There are many examples of acquisitions that have been successful and have continued to operate. Take examples of Slack, Github, etc. But, if we fundamentally operate with an exit strategy in mind, then we are not building a product for the long term and definitely not for the users.




### Scalability requirement

Many a times externalities like regulatory changes, market disruption, compliance and legal requirements, etc. force a company to sunset a product. And not in all cases, does there exist a situation where there are so many people still want to use the product, but the company is not able to sustain the cost of running the product or get enough users to make it sustainable or to generate enough profit.

Take example of Google Reader, it was a great product and people literally opened a petition on change.org to keep it alive. But Google shut it down because?

The "not enough usage" excuse is usually cover for "not enough profitable usage that fits our current strategy."

So is the case with Pocket.

### Company inefficiency
Examples in this category are hard to quote as no company is willing to share their internal inefficiencies when they shut down.

### Externalities

## Our pillars for lasting long

### 1. Staying lean

Case of software building, the core essense of venture capital,

examples of lean running - DayOne etc. - connect userbase number parallels with the products discussed in scalability requirement above.


### 2. Open source
