Hello community!! After several months of crafting Memotron... we are all set to revolutionize how we manage our digital memory ðŸ”¥
<!-- truncate -->

Check this short and [crisp video](https://youtu.be/SeWdndc7y4A) that we made to understand Memotron's ability to transform the way you learn, research, think and create!
I have been using digital memory tools for almost a decade now... I started with Zoho notebook, then used Onenote, Evernote, MS Excel, Notion for a long time and tried 100+ PKM/note-taking apps time to time...

Every single app that claims as a PKM tool fundamentally lacks certain core elements of what a PKM tool should be. After a lot of deep ideation, brainstorming and design iterations - we have arrived at whole new system of organizing knowledge. We named it NCCL and check this link to learn more about this system and our design process here.

And yes, we built this as a 3 member team - thanks Saikiran Rudra and Fuzail Haaris for your invaluable contribution in crafting this product ðŸš€ ðŸš€

Appreciate everyone's support to help our effort to bring PKM closer for everyone!

P.S: Yes, we do have AI in our tool and guess what, its free and works offline!
