## Comprehensive dark patterns list in UX design

The following comprehensive list covers various categories of dark patterns commonly found in digital products and services.

| Pattern Name | Category | Description & Examples | Psychological Principle | Harm Level |
|--------------|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| **Bait and Switch** | Deception | User expects one outcome but receives another, undesirable result. *Example: Windows 10 upgrade dialog where clicking 'X' initiated upgrade instead of closing the window.* | Expectation violation, trust exploitation | High |
| **Hidden Costs** | Financial Deception | Additional fees revealed only at final checkout after user investment. *Example: TicketMaster showing base ticket prices then adding service and delivery fees at payment.* | Sunk cost fallacy, commitment escalation | High |
| **Drip Pricing** | Financial Deception | Full price disclosed incrementally throughout purchase process. *Example: Airline booking showing base fare then gradually adding baggage, seat selection, and tax fees.* | Loss aversion, incremental commitment | High |
| **Forced Continuity** | Financial Coercion | Automatic billing after free trial without clear warning or easy cancellation. *Example: Streaming services charging post-trial without renewal reminders or simple cancellation.* | Inertia exploitation, payment automation | High |

| **Information Fragmentation** | Content Manipulation | Breaking simple information across multiple pages unnecessarily. *Example: Multi-page articles or product specs designed to maximize page views rather than user convenience.* | Attention exploitation, artificial engagement | Low |
| **Artificial Scarcity** | Pressure Tactics | False claims of limited availability for unlimited digital goods. *Example: "Only 3 left at this price" messages for digital downloads or online courses.* | Scarcity heuristic, urgency creation | Medium |
| **Emotional Triggers** | Psychological Manipulation | Using fear, guilt, or urgency to manipulate decisions. *Example: Travel booking sites asking "Stay unsecured?" when user declines insurance coverage.* | Emotional reasoning, fear exploitation | Medium |
| **Gamification Exploitation** | Behavioral Manipulation | Game mechanics encouraging excessive usage or spending. *Example: Streak counters and daily rewards that pressure continued usage regardless of user value or need.* | Variable reward schedule, loss aversion | Medium |
| **Cookie Wall** | Access Restriction | Blocking content unless tracking cookies are accepted. *Example: News websites preventing article reading until user accepts all tracking cookies and data collection.* | Forced consent, access gatekeeping | High |
| **Algorithmic FOMO** | AI Manipulation | AI-curated content designed to maximize envy and engagement. *Example: Social media feeds showing carefully selected lifestyle content to trigger social comparison and insecurity.* | Personalized psychological targeting, social comparison | High |
