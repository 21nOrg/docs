# Core concepts
Every app has an underlying system design that makes the app work. Unfortunately, most of the times, it is implicit, based on founder's intuition and undocumented. We have thoughtfully crafted the design of Pointron to make focusing as frictionless as it can be and we have documented it here.

The below is the underlying method that Pointron relies on to make the best use of your time.

## The double funnel method

The double funnel method is a way to break down both your work and your time into smaller and smaller chunks until it becomes actionable while leaving the high-mid levels intact to enable planning, reflection and learning.





### Work breakdown funnel
Mentioned below is the hierarchy of information in Pointron.

[Collections](/features/collections) (High level)

â‡Š

[Goals](/features/goals) (Mid level)


â‡Š

[Tasks](/features/tasks) (Atomic level)




### Time breakdown funnel
Years -> Months -> Weeks -> Days -> Hours
