# Core concepts
Every app has an underlying system design that makes the app work. Unfortunately, most of the times, it is implicit, based on founder's intuition and undocumented. We have thoughtfully crafted the design of Nucleus to make personal productivity as frictionless as it can be and we have documented it here.

As part of our mission, we will be building more components to personal producivity right into Nucleus. And these components will not form a suite of loosely packed tools, but rather a cohesive system that works together to help you through various aspects of your life.
