> When to use what?

As with any tools that has a lot of features, Pointron if not used efficiently can become hard to maintain and anti productive. In this guide, we will dive deeper into some common patterns and questions that might arise while you use Pointron.

## Indefinite goal vs definite goal

- Choose `Indefinite goal` when you want to pursue a goal without any deadlines or fixed timeline. 
- Choose `Definite goal` when you want to pursue a goal with a fixed timeline and deadlines.

### Examples

- Indefinite goal: 
  - Reading
  - Listen to podcasts
- Definite goal: 
  - Read 100 pages of a book in 1 month
  - Complete design project
  - Study for SAT exam


## Indefinite goal vs Repeating task vs Habit

* Indefinite goal: A simple objective that you want to achieve that doesn't have the below
  * No deadline and fixed timeline
  * No specific time slots or intervals at which you want to perform this work
  * You don't want to habitually perform this work without any external reminders
  
* Repeating task: A light-weight task that you want to perform regularly at set intervals.
  * You don't want to remember to perform this task and you need reminders to perform this task.
  * You are sure when and how often you want to perform this task.
  
* Habit: A light-weight task that you want to perform regularly at set intervals and you want to habitually perform this work without any external reminders.
    * This requires a natural cue from your life or environment to form the habit.

### Examples

  - Reading
