We neither want every user to create an account with us nor do we sell any information that we get from the signed up users. So, please donâ€™t create a cloud sync account, if you are going to use the app only on a single device and without Clippers.

:::note

We still have minor dependencies on the internet for loading icons etc which we will be removing in the upcoming updates.

:::

### Offline mode
If you have decided to create a cloud sync account with us based on your use case, you can still turn on offline mode if you want to go camp in the woods or choose to not buy wifi on your next airplane trip.
