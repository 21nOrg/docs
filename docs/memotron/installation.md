:::tip

The above extension should work for all Chromium based browsers including but not limited to Google Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Wavebox etc.

:::

:::warning[Note]

Arc browser doesn’t support sidePanel API. Therefore, our side panel interface which is available on all other Chromium based browsers is not available if you use Memotron extension from Arc browser. We will support this feature in the future by taking alternative approaches.
