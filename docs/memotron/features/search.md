What’s the point of a digital memory system if we can’t retrieve the memory unit when we need it? Memotron’s search just works!

Use the global search shortcut (`Ctrl + K`) or search anything from library using the keywords that you have used when creating those resources.

<!-- We got you covered even in cases when you can’t remember the keywords. Just toggle the Semantic search, put anything that you vaguely remember into search bar and let the AI model do the search for you. -->

| Shortcut | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| `Ctrl + K` | Global search shortcut |
| `Ctrl + (left/right arrow)` | To switch between resource tabs |
| `Ctrl + Shift + (left/right arrow)` | To switch between resource groups when `Everything` tab is active |
| `Alt + click` | To open a search result as split for quick preview to avoid closing and re-opening of search pop-up |

:::note

Use ```Cmd``` in place of ```Ctrl``` and ```Opt``` in place of ```Alt``` for Mac.
