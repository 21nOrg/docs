Use Relations to maintain relationships for connections that you make on Memotron.

**Example:**

Imagine you are researching about a topic and you linked 50 different relevant information to it. As the information grows, coming back and utilizing the connected information can feel daunting. Thatâ€™s when relations can help segregate information and utilize it efficiently when coming back to it.

Example relations include:

1. Simple relationships like ```author``` , ```duplicate``` , ```relevant```, ```1995```

2. Giving importance or weight to the connection to store the relevancy of connected information: ```relevancy:strong``` , ```relevancy:weak```, ```weight:5```, ```weight:3``` , ```important``` , ```very useful``` etc

3. Status of information incorporation like ```status:used``` , ```status:ignored```, ```status:further-research``` etc

4. To carry out analysis like SWOT, Decision matrix, Cost-benefit analysis, weighted decision matrix, etc - ```threat```, ```strength``` , ```pro```, ```con```, ```conclusive``` etc
