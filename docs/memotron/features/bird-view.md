To access bird view, open a node and click on `Bird view`.

Birdâ€™s eye view aka. Bird view is our craftsmanship for you to visually look at any resource in Memotron from a higher angle or bigger picture.

While we are still working other layouts like **Fuzzy layout** or **Timeline layout**, we released graph layout for you to get a quick glance of all the connections for any given node.
