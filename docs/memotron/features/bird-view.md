Birdâ€™s eye view aka. Bird view is our craftsmanship for you to visually look at any resource in Memotron from a higher angle or bigger picture.

While we are still working on our proprietary ```Fuzzy sub view```, we released graph sub view for you to get a quick glance of all the connections for any given node.
