As we are becoming increasingly global & digital citizens, the apps we use should also leave a room for us to configure our timezone, when we start our day, what time scales we prefer to look at our life timeline etc.

Memotron provides all these settings for you to configure. While it may not seem useful in the current version of the app, these settings will become really handy when we introduce Calendar in our upcoming updates.
