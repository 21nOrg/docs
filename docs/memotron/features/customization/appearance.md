Just like how we modern humans spend a good amount of time to design our living spaces, we believe that the apps that we use also should be configurable enough. After all, the line between digital and physical spaces is no longer traceable.

Colors, typeface, font size etc - all constitute to how a app looks and feels. Go to ```Appearance settings``` on Memotron and choose the right kind of color scheme, skin, typeface and sizing for the text that suits you the best.

:::note
Typeface and skin settings will be available in the later releases.
