Round trip capture is something that we can notice in many knowledge management solutions. It is to capture information at the destination and not at the origin of information.

**Example:** If we want to add a new entry to a database in our PKM system, we would have to navigate to that database to add a new entry.

Memotronâ€™s direct linking ability makes it super easy to add new entries to collections or link to an existing node. Not just from the app but also from web extension. And not just adding but also capturing useful information like properties, relationship, notes etc. all with a single interaction.
