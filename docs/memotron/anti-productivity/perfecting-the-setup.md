Most of the setup required is taken care by the design and the underlying NCCL system of Memotron. Contemporary PKM tools encourage the setup and templates aspect of their tools as it would increase community engagement. But, that effects the productivity of the app - the sole reason why the app exists in the first place.

### Whatâ€™s wrong with the design of existing tools?

The design of the existing tools fundamentally requires users to endlessly setup and maintain the workflows. Speaking in terms of Memotron terminology, the design of existing tools try to achieve ```Combination``` via markdown. This might be very useful for some use cases but for a typical PKM workflow, this is more work to do than actual work.
