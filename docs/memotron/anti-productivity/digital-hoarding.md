> _"Other names: Collectorâ€™s fallacy"_

More often than not, we run into this anti pattern when using a digital memory tool. And with a tool like Memotron where capturing new information is a breeze, it will become increasingly challenging to decide what to capture and what to not. We want to solve this problem in Memotron with the below features. (These features are not available yet and will be available soon)

1. Marking a collection as archive

2. Retrieval score

3. Link score

### Marking as archive

Marking a collection as archive lets the app know that you are collecting stuff in that collection just for future reference and may not open items from that collection frequently. The app will reduce the priority for these collections to check against ```Retrieval score``` or ```Link score```.

### Retrieval score

Retrieval score is a simple and useful metric which tells the user on whether items in a collection are being used or opened or referenced. If you want to proactively utilize certain knowledge, you can use this metric.

### Link score

Link score tells how connected the nodes are in your Memotron. If you are relying on note-taking methods like Zettlekasten, you can use this score to understand how connected the knowledge is in your Memotron.
