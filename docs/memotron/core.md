# Core Concepts

Understanding Memotron's core concepts will help you make the most of the application.

## Notes

Notes are the fundamental building blocks in Memotron. Each note can contain text, images, code blocks, and other types of content.

## Collections

[Collections](../features/collections.md) help you organize related notes together. They can be:
- Simple collections
- Typed collections
- Query-based collections

## Links

Links create connections between notes, allowing you to build a network of knowledge. Learn more about [linking](../features/linking.md).

## Tags

Tags provide a flexible way to categorize and filter your notes. They can be used across collections and help in quick retrieval of information.
