As a concious company, however small it is, we are commited to make every single effort to help preserve the planet. Please help us by using Memotron in a green way. Read the suggestions below to become part of our mission.

### Use the offline version

If you are going to use Memotron on a single device, please download and use the full offline version of our app. The offline version does not require any internet connection or signup. It helps reduce the carbon emissions involved with data transfer for syncing your data continuously to the cloud and storing your data on the cloud.

### Turn on offline mode

According to your use case, if you have decided to have your data synced to the cloud, please turn on offline mode if you primarily use Memotron on a single device. Occasionally turning off the offline mode will still sync all your data to the cloud. You can toggle this setting in **Sync settings**.

### Improve local AI along with us

We stumbled upon using AI locally on user's device when we were trying to cut down costs as a small startup. We soon realized the green potential of using smaller local AI models which work pretty well for most of the use cases. We are working on improving our local AI and would love your feedback. Please join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/9HJqKYTZKg) and help us make Memotron greener.
