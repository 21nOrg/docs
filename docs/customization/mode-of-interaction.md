Well, techies like to perform actions with a single command while not very geeky users might prefer it more visual and verbose. We have built several modes of interaction that are listed below so that using the app feels just right for you.

1. Default

2. Command only

3. Agent mode (coming soon...)

### Default

Default mode tries to blend all the modes of interaction while still maintaining a serenity on the user interface. Use this mode if you prefer visual way of interaction and doesnâ€™t mind using your mouse or trackpad to navigate your way around.

### Command only

Command only is taking keyboard centric interaction to next level. All that verbose design will hide away making way to a very simple but yet powerful command bar. Use command bar to search and perform any action in the app. Every action is one command away no matter how many mouse interactions deep that is in verbose mode.

### Agent mode (coming soon...)

We are in 21st century and we already have early AGI taking rides. Agent mode is command only mode but performing multiple actions at once with simple commands. We want to use this mode as much as you look forward to it. We will be releasing this mode of interaction in our upcoming release.
