# Typed collections

Collection gives the ability to collect homogenous information with certain common attributes.

Ex: People, Bookmarks, Movies, Books, Wander list, Bucket list, Product Ideas, Content ideas, Quotes, Recipes etc

Or use collections to collect anything without the need to worry about advanced capabilities like assigning properties etc.

Simple collections can be handy to collect any kind of information which doesn’t have much common attributes to them.

Ex: Random memes, Cool websites, thoughts, ideas, photography collection etc.


<!-- :::tip

Assign singular name in settings for typed collections if you create a capture shortcut.

## Properties

Property as the name suggests is a mechanism to add additional information for the nodes. As an alternative, we can add all the information in text format on our markdown. But, properties makes capturing this additional information and later visualizing it much better when compared to full text based information.

Example:

I can capture my recipe experiments in Recipes collection. I can choose to give rating or add date in markdown itself. Or I can choose to create properties like rating, date, ingredients etc.

Using properties will unlock possibilities like quickly capturing rating or date from mobile when I add my new recipe entry or later visualize my recipe experiments on a nice Calendar heat map etc.

## Extending a type
Extend an existing type to make use of a base collection to have derived collections with different properties.
