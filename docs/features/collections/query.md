Use query collections to save frequently used filters as a query. Any new item that meets those requirements will be automatically added to the query collection.

Examples:

1. All my ```image``` nodes which I captured in ```x``` location in the ```last 12 months``` with ```rating 3 and above```.

2. All ```markdown``` nodes where I mentioned ```y``` person but didnâ€™t mention ```z``` person and has a link to ```work``` node.
