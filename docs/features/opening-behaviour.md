| Opening behavior          | Shortcut                |

## Tabs

Tabs gives you a way to pin the most relevant resources at a given point of time. Use ```Open as tab``` option from context menu to open any resource as a tab.

## Split

Often times, we need to cross reference resources opening them side by side. Memotron gives an easy way to do that without relying on archaic split screen setups provided by native Operating systems. Just use ```Alt (Opt) + click``` shortcut or click on ```Open as split``` option from the context menu.

:::tip[Quick tip]
Use Alt + Click to quickly open resources even during search. This way, you can skim through search results real fast.

## Full screen
If you want to focus a particular resource and you donâ€™t want anything to come in the way, use ```Open in full screen``` option from the context menu or use ```Shift + Click``` shortcut.
