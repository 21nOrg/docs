# Collections

Collections are a mechanism to collect items together. Some note-taking methods like Zettelkasten might heavily rely on linking to organize knowledge, other methods requires some structure to organizing information.

## TLDR

| Collection type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Simple | To collect unstructured or possibly heterogenous data without any common characteristics or properties |
| Typed | To collect similar type of data together with common characteristics or properties |
| Query | To save a frequently used search query as collection |
